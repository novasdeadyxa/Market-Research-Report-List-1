<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shield Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slurry Shield Machines</li><li>Water-pressure Shield Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The shield machine market comprises primarily two types: slurry shield machines and water-pressure shield machines. Slurry shield machines utilize a mixture of water and bentonite to balance earth pressure during tunneling, making them ideal for loose or saturated soil conditions. In contrast, water-pressure shield machines rely on hydraulic pressure to support excavation, effectively managing water-laden environments. Both types are essential in modern civil engineering for constructing tunnels, subways, and underground infrastructure, each serving specific geological conditions.</p></p>
